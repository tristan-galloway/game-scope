# Gaming Hub

## Description
My idea is to have a webpage that will display info about video games. I chose this subject just because I enjoy video gaming and would like to have a website built around the hobby. Following is the general info brainstormed so far.

## Site Layout
Pages
- [Homepage](https://tristan-galloway.github.io/game-scope/): Display trending games.
- [Game Details](https://tristan-galloway.github.io/game-scope/details.html): Information about a specific game.
- [Favorites](https://tristan-galloway.github.io/game-scope/favorite.html): Track your favorite games.

## Important Links
- [RAWG API](https://rawg.io/apidocs)
- [Icon pack](https://www.iconfinder.com/search?q=&family=accent-duo-tone-icons)
